MissingOutputException in rule multiqc in file /projectnb/bf528/students/jawa/project-1-template-jawa23bio/week1.snake, line 25:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/final_multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
