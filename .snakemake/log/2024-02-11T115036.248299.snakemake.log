MissingOutputException in rule star in file /projectnb/bf528/students/jawa/project-1-template-jawa23bio/snake_check, line 2:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/BAMResults/ADrep1subsample_R1.Aligned.out.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
