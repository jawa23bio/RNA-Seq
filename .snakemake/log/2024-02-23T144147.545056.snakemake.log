MissingOutputException in rule verse in file /projectnb/bf528/students/jawa/project-1-template-jawa23bio/week3.snake, line 11:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/ADrep1subsample.exon.txt
results/ADrep2subsample.exon.txt
results/P0rep1subsample.exon.txt
results/P0rep2subsample.exon.txt
