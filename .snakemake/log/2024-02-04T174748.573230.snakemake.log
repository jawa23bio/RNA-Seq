ImproperOutputException in rule multiqc in file /projectnb/bf528/students/jawa/project-1-template-jawa23bio/week1.snake, line 25:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule multiqc:
    output: results/final_multiqc_report.html
    affected files:
        results/final_multiqc_report.html
Removing output files of failed job multiqc since they might be corrupted:
results/final_multiqc_report.html
Skipped removing non-empty directory results/final_multiqc_report.html
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
