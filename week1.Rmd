# Conceptual Questions

In this repo, in the docs section, we have provided you with a multiQC report
generated from the full data run with the same tools as you have. Compare the
report **you** generated from the subsampled data to the provided report.

1. When comparing the two reports, which modules appear to be most influenced by 
    the size of the files? Which modules show consistent results?



2. Look at the **full** report, you'll notice that the duplication rates for the
    P0, P4, and P7 samples appear to be relatively close together (~50%). The 
    duplication rates for the AD samples appear to be much higher. Provide at least
    one biological and one technical reason that might explain these results. Can you
    describe how you might confirm your provided explanations.
